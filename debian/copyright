LICENSE: GPL-2+
eWoms is licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
Public License (GPL) version 2 or - at your option - any later
version. At this point we would like explicitly state the fact that
this license also includes version three [3] of the GPL. The GPL can
be read online [2, 3], or in the LICENSE file provided in the topmost
directory of the eWoms source code tree.

Please note that eWoms' license, unlike DUNE's, does _NOT_ feature a
template exception from the GNU General Public License. This means
that you must publish any source code under a compatible license which
uses any of the eWoms header files if you want to redistribute your
program to third parties. (Note that the GPL only applies to code
which you redistribute; If you don't pass the modified code, the
modifications don't need to be covered by the GPL.)
