What is eWoms?
==============

eWoms [0] is a “friendly fork” of the Dumux simulation framework [1]
for flow and transport in porous media. It follows a more agile
development model with a lower priority on backward compatibility and
higher openness to disruptive changes. To facilitate distributed
development, eWoms uses git instead of Subversion as its revision
control system.

“eWoms” is an acronym for the German idiom “eierlegende Wollmilchsau”
(egg-laying wool-milk pig) and reflects the fact that the goal of this
project is to create an all-encompassing simulation framework for
flow-and transport in porous media.

copyright holders.

INSTALLATION
============

There are two ways to install eWoms: The first is to use the DUNE's
build system, the other is to use CMake. If you just want to evaluate
eWoms, we recommend to compile eWoms the DUNE way as outlined in the
INSTALL file. On the other hand, if you would like to develop with
eWoms, using the CMake based build system has advantages like much
faster configure runs and out-of-tree builds. In this case, follow the
instructions from INSTALL.cmake.

LICENSE
=======

eWoms is licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
Public License (GPL) version 2 or - at your option - any later
version. At this point we would like explicitly state the fact that
this license also includes version three [3] of the GPL. The GPL can
be read online [2, 3], or in the LICENSE file provided in the topmost
directory of the eWoms source code tree.

Please note that eWoms' license, unlike DUNE's, does _NOT_ feature a
template exception from the GNU General Public License. This means
that you must publish any source code under a compatible license which
uses any of the eWoms header files if you want to redistribute your
program to third parties. (Note that the GPL only applies to code
which you redistribute; If you don't pass the modified code, the
modifications don't need to be covered by the GPL.)
