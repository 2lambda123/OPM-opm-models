What is eWoms?
==============

eWoms [0, 5] is an module of the Open Porous Media initiative (OPM)
[6] which is focused on implementing fully-implicit general-purpose
models for flow and transport in porous media. This means that its
goals are to be a easily usable, well maintainable, high performance
framework which is -- in principle -- capable of capturing all
macro-scale scenarios relevant for academic research and industrial
applications that involve flow and transport processes in porous
media. Like all other OPM modules eWoms is available under the terms
of the GNU General Public License (GPL). In contrast to the other OPM
modules eWoms is licensed under version 2 (instead of version 3) or -
at your option - any later version of the GPL.

eWoms uses an agile development model similar to the one of the other
OPM modules. This means that, the development branch is considered
unstable and eWoms releases often contain "hard" programming interface
changes. For this reason, people primarily interested in using eWoms
are advertised to follow a release branch and to carefully read the
change log before upgrading to a new version. Currently, eWoms follows
the release schedule OPM, i.e., it is indended to prepare two releases
a year. All releases will be supported for two consecutive cycles.

The term "eWoms" is an acronym for the German idiom "eierlegende
Wollmilchsau" (egg-laying wool-milk pig) and reflects the fact that
the goal of this project is to create an all-encompassing simulation
framework for flow-and transport in porous media. The source code of
eWoms is based on the one of the Dumux framework [1], but both project
have diverged considerably since they separated.

INSTALLATION
============

For compiling and installing eWoms the 'dunecontrol' script from
DUNE's build system should be used. For further details see the
INSTALL file.

LICENSE
=======

If not stated otherwise in the respective source code files, eWoms is
licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public
License (GPL) version two or - at your option - any later version. At
this point, we would like explicitly state the fact that this license
also includes version three [3] of the GPL. The exact wording of the
GPL can either be read online [2, 3] or it can be found in the file
COPYING in the topmost directory of the eWoms source code tree.

Please note that eWoms' license -- unlike DUNE's -- does _NOT_ contain
a template exception from the GPL. This means that for any program
which uses any of the eWoms header files, you must provide the
modified program's full source code under the GPL to everyone to whom
you provide the modified program. (Note that this that this statement
only applies to programs which are provided to third parties, i.e.,
programs which use code from eWoms but which are not distributed, do
not need be covered by the GPL.)
