What is eWoms?
==============

eWoms [0, 5] is an module of the Open Porous Media initiative (OPM)
[7] which is primary focused on fully implicit models for flow and
transport in porous media. Its main objectives are to provide a easily
usable, well maintainable, high performance framework which is capable
of capturing all macro-scale scenarios relevant for academic research
and industrial applications involving flow and transport processes in
porous media. Like all other OPM modules eWoms is available under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.

eWoms uses an agile development model similar to the one of the other
OPM modules. This means that, the development branch is considered
unstable and eWoms releases often contain "hard" programming interface
changes. For this reason, people primarily interested in using eWoms
are advertised to follow a stable branch and to carefully read the
change log before upgrading to a new version. Currently, a new eWoms
release will prepared rougthly every six months, which will then be
supported for two consecutive cycles.

The term "eWoms" is an acronym for the German idiom "eierlegende
Wollmilchsau" (egg-laying wool-milk pig) and reflects the fact that
the goal of this project is to create an all-encompassing simulation
framework for flow-and transport in porous media. The source code of
eWoms is based on the one of the Dumux framework [1], but both project
have diverged considerably since they separated.

INSTALLATION
============

There are two ways to install eWoms: The first is to use the DUNE's
build system, the other is to use CMake. If you just want to evaluate
eWoms, we recommend to compile eWoms the DUNE way as outlined in the
INSTALL file. On the other hand, if you would like to develop with
eWoms, using the CMake based build system has advantages like much
faster configure runs and out-of-tree builds. In this case, follow the
instructions from INSTALL.cmake.

LICENSE
=======

eWoms is licensed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General
Public License (GPL) version 2 or - at your option - any later
version. At this point, we would like explicitly state the fact that
this license also includes version three [3] of the GPL. The GPL can
be read online [2, 3] and is also embedded in the file COPYING in the
topmost directory of the eWoms source code tree.

Please note that eWoms' license -- unlike DUNE's -- does _NOT_ feature
a template exception from the GNU General Public License. This means
that you must publish any source code under a compatible license which
uses any of the eWoms header files if you want to redistribute your
program to third parties. (Note, that the GPL only applies to code
which you redistribute; If you don't pass the modified code, the
modifications don't need to be covered by the GPL.)

See the file COPYING for the full wording of the license and the 
copyright holders.
