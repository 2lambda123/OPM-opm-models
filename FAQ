What is eWoms?
==============

eWoms [0] is a fork of the Dumux simulation framework [1] for flow and
transport in porous media. It follows a more agile development model
with a lower priority on backward compatibility and higher openness to
disruptive changes. To facilitate distributed development, eWoms uses
git [2] instead of Subversion [3] as its revision control system as
well using github.com [6], a public website, to host its source code
repositories

“eWoms” is an acronym for the German idiom “eierlegende Wollmilchsau”
(egg-laying wool-milk pig) and reflects the fact that the goal of this
project is to create an all-encompassing simulation framework.

Quick, I want to try it!
========================

The short answer:

    git clone https://github.com/OPM/ewoms.git ewoms

The long answer: To use eWoms, you need the following DUNE modules
(each needs to be version 2.2.0 or newer): dune-common, dune-geometry,
dune-grid, dune-localfunctions and dune-istl. You may either download
and extract the tarballs from the DUNE website or check them out from
their Subversion repositories using the following bash script:

    for MOD in common geometry grid localfunctions istl; do
        svn checkout \  
            https://svn.dune-project.org/svn/dune-$MOD/branches/release-2.2 \
            dune-$MOD  
    done

After you've checked out the required DUNE modules, you need to check
out eWoms using the above command, i.e.

    git clone https://github.com/OPM/ewoms.git ewoms

Finally, you need to compile everything using:

    ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol \
        --opts=ewoms/debug.opts \
        --module=ewoms \
        all
    cd ewoms
    make check

If the build was successful, you will find some test applications in
the sub-folders of ‘test/’. Each of these can be executed by just
punching the name of the executable into the terminal. For the
fully-implicit two-phase example application, this means

cd test/boxmodels/2p
./lens_immiscible
# Simulation runs

The results can then be visualized using ParaView:

paraview --data=$(ls --sort=time *.pvd | grep -v convergence | head -n 1)

How do I get changes in?
========================

If you want to only occasionally contribute a patch, you may create a
pull request [4] on github or post it to the OPM mailing list
[5]. After you've acquired a track record, we will offer you full push
rights.

What is the eWoms release model?
================================

A new release of eWoms is prepared every six months if there are
enough changes to justify a major release. Bug-fix releases are
released ad-hoc with the sole purpose of fixing errors which creeped
into the last major release (i.e. they do not contain any new
features). Each major release drops out of support after two successor
releases, i.e. usually after a year.
