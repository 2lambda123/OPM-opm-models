What is Dumux-eWoms?
====================

Dumux-eWoms is a branch of the Dumux [0] simulator for flow and
transport porous media. It follows a more agile development model
which does not consider backward compatibility a high priority. Also,
Dumux-eWoms uses git [1] as source-code management system which
makes distributed development much easier compared to subversion.

Quick, I want to try it!
========================

git clone git@gitorious.org:dumux-ewoms/dumux-ewoms.git dumux-eWoms

If you prefer a tarball, you may download one of the releases from the
Dumux-eWoms homepage at https://gitorious.org/dumux-ewoms/pages/Home

How do I get changes in?
========================

If you want to only occasionally contribute a patch, you may create a
merge request on gitorious [2, 3]. After you've aquired a track
record, we will offer you full push rights.

What is the Dumux-eWoms release model?
======================================

A new release of Dumux-eWoms is prepared every six months if there are
enough changes to justify a major release. Point releases are released
ad-hoc with the sole purpose of fixing errors which creeped inte the
last major release (i.e. they do not contain any new features). Each
major release drops out of support after two successor releases,
i.e. usually after a year.
