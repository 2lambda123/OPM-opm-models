Installation Instructions
=========================

This file describes how to compile and install eWoms using DUNE's
standard autotools based build system. If you would like to use the
alternative CMake based build system, please read the file
INSTALL.cmake.

eWoms is implemented as an ordinary DUNE module. For a full
explanation of the DUNE installation process, please read the
installation notes on the internet [0]. The following introduction is
meant for the impatient.

Getting started
---------------

In order to compile eWoms, you first have to install the following
DUNE modules so that DUNE's 'dunecontrol' finds them:
 
  - dune-common        from [1]
  - dune-geometry      from [1]
  - dune-grid          from [1]
  - dune-istl          from [1]
  - dune-localfuctions from [1]

If you are using Ubuntu 12.10 or newer or Debian Wheezy or newer, you
may install these modules using the standard Debian package management
tools:

    sudo apt-get install libdune-grid-dev libdune-istl-dev libdune-localfunctions-dev 

On Ubuntu, make sure that you have the 'Universe' package repositories
enabled.  Besides the Debian based distributions, DUNE packages for
openSUSE (>= 12.2) are also available. These can be installed using the
following commands:

   sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/science/openSUSE_12.2
   sudo zypper ref
   sudo zypper in dune-grid-devel dune-localfunctions-devel dune-istl-devel

If you use a different Linux distribution or want to live on the
bleeding edge, you need to download the sources directly from the
website of the DUNE project. For this, follow the instructions at
[1]. For eWoms you currently need either the 2.2 release or the latest
2.3 trunk version.

With option files you can enable options, set compiler flags and
define paths to external libraries. Exemplary option files are located
in $EWOMS_ROOT/optim.opts and $EWOMS_ROOT/debug.opts respectively.
($EWOMS_ROOT is the directory where the unpacked files of the eWoms
package are located.)

After you've obtained DUNE, compile eWoms using

  $PATH_TO_DUNECONTROL/dunecontrol --opts=$(EWOMS_ROOT)/optim.opts --module=ewoms all
  cd $EWOMS_ROOT
  make check # <- only required if you want to compile the example applications

A more comprehensive introduction to the DUNE build system can be
found at [2].
