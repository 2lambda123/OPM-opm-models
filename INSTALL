Installation Instructions
=========================

This file describes how to compile and install eWoms using DUNE's
standard autotools based build system. If you would like to use the
alternative CMake based build system, please read the file
INSTALL.cmake.

eWoms is implemented as an ordinary DUNE module. For a full
explanation of the DUNE installation process, please read the
installation notes on the internet [0]. The following introduction is
meant for the impatient.

Getting started
---------------

In order to compile eWoms, you first have to download and extract the
following DUNE modules into your source directory:
 
  - dune-common        from [1]
  - dune-geometry      from [1]
  - dune-grid          from [1]
  - dune-istl          from [1]
  - dune-localfuctions from [1]

Use either the 2.2 release or the 2.3-svn trunk. 

With option files you can enable options, set compiler flags and
define paths to external libraries. Exemplary option files are located 
in $EWOMS_ROOT/optim.opts and $EWOMS_ROOT/debug.opts respectively. 
($EWOMS_ROOT is the directory where the unpacked files of the eWoms
distribution are located.) 

A mandatory option to be included in CONFIGURE_FLAGS is:
--enable-fieldvector-size-is-method

Now compile everything with

  ./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=$(EWOMS_ROOT)/optim.opts --module=dumux all

A more comprehensive introduction to the DUNE build system can be
found in [2].
