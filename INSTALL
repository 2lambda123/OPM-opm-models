Installation Instructions
=========================

This file describes how to compile and install eWoms. eWoms is
implemented as an DUNE module within the umbrella of the Open Porous
Media (OPM) project.

Getting started
---------------

In order to compile eWoms, you first have to install the following
DUNE and OPM modules by following their installation instructions:

  - opm-material       from [3]
  - opm-common         from [3]
  - dune-common        from [0]
  - dune-geometry      from [0]
  - dune-grid          from [0]
  - dune-istl          from [0]
  - dune-localfuctions from [0]

If you like to use the ECL Black-Oil simulator (ebos), you also need
the following modules:

  - opm-parser         from [3]
  - opm-core           from [3]
  - dune-cornerpoint   from [3]

For eWoms, the latest release or development branch version of the
prerequisite software usually works fine.

To compile eWoms, it is recommended the dunecontrol script from the
dune-common module. This allows to conveniently specify the compiler
which ought to be used to compile eWoms and its dependencies, set the
compiler's flags and to define the paths to (optional) external
libraries. In this context, it is advisable to adapt the option files
$EWOMS_DIR/optim.opts or $EWOMS_DIR/debug.opts to your particular
needs.

After you've obtained the required modules, you can compile eWoms using

  $PATH_TO_DUNECONTROL/dunecontrol --opts=$(EWOMS_ROOT)/optim.opts --module=ewoms all

Testing
-------

eWoms uses CTest for regression testing [1]. We encourage you to
participate - it's easy: If you set up an build directory for eWoms
with the examples enabled as described above, just run

   ctest -D Experimental -j$NUM_CORES

After a while, your results will appear on the eWoms CDash 
dashboard [2].
